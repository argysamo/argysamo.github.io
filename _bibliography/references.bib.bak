AiRCHIVE is a software platform for providing open access to sensor data with different ways, that account for machine interoperability. It is built with Raspberry Pi, a low-cost, pocket-size computer, and Air Pi a low-cost amateur sensory kit for air quality monitoring. Raspberry Pi with AirPi allowed us to easily capture raw sensor data and store them in a local database, and with AiRCHIVE we deployed “on sensor” a web server that provides with a set of services for data preprocessing and dissemination, including an implementation of OGC/SOS services and the OAI/PMH harvesting protocol.},

  abstract      = {Extreme events such as frost, drought or excessive heat occurring during a critical plant stage can cause extensive and sometimes irreversible damages to agricultural production. Tools for gauging the occurrence of extreme events can thus play an important role in the context of agricultural decision problems. Agroclimatic indicators offer simple means to discriminate between favourable and unfavourable conditions. Their evaluation can be supported by dedicated software tools, even though this typically requires local installation of the proposed solution. Here we present webXTREME, a new web-based tool to characterize the occurrence and intensity of extreme events in agriculture (available through www.modextreme.org/webxtreme, accessed on 6 April, 2016). Objectives, which motivated its development, were: ease of access (available from any internet-connected device), simple setup, universal compatibility (no installation required), extensibility and the possibility to offer regular updating services. webXTREME was designed to help scientists and practitioners with various backgrounds to configure the solving algorithms by taking into account plant-specific thresholds and relevant time windows during the growing seasons of arable crops, grasslands and woody species. Graphical display of the results enables comparative assessments, either in space or in time. webXTREME was implemented using Shiny, an open-source web application framework for R. This allows combining the computational power of dedicated R functions with modern web technologies. webXTREME can easily be integrated into other modelling platforms (e.g. BioMA, http://bioma.jrc.ec.europa.eu).},

  abstract  = {Every-day devices are being miniaturized, equipped with transducers and transformed into internet-connected sensor nodes. Above smart-devices, not only can sense their surroundings, but could also store and disseminate their observations. While Internet of the Things (IoT) introduces a new, dynamic, participatory ecosystem of decentralized and collaborative devices, intrinsic heterogeneity hinders its full realization. Diversity of smart-devices and their resulting data formats, demands for interoperable data curation solutions. Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has put significant work towards interoperable data interchange. Through Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) and its related service interfaces, and information models, OGC offers syntactic and semantic interoperability. Sensor Observation Service (SOS), is a well-established, pull-based service interface. Through its web service specification, clients are provided with interoperable means for accessing sensor observations. In this work, we investigate the SOS suitability to operate in an environment of restrained-capabilities’ devices (in terms of bandwidth and processing power). We argue, that current SOS design ill performs in specific temporal and/or spatial requests, and we present a new one. Suggested design was motivated by IoT features (i.e. limited-capabilities devices and opportunistic internet connection), and drafted so as to have a non-invasive nature (e.g. a SOS server, implementing our design can be reached in most cases, by current SOS clients). Our proposed SOS design is based on progressive data transmission, facilitates selective data retrieval, and adds a disruption/fault-tolerant attribute to the standard itself, while ensuring the “no a-priori knowledge” SOS specification. Finally, implementing both designs, current and proposed, incorporating them into SOS servers, and evaluating them against two case-studies, we demonstrate that our design leads to high-performance in some cases (e.g. irregular timeseries), while adds only a little overhead in all others.},

Additional services are required for interoperable data sharing and visualization. We designed and implemented a software tool called Airchive to run on a Raspberry Pi, in order to assemble a data repository for archiving and openly sharing timeseries data. Airchive employs a relational database for storing data and implements two standards for sharing data (namely the Sensor Observation Service by the Open Geospatial Consortium and the Protocol for Metadata Harvesting by the Open Archives Initiative). The system is demonstrated in a realistic indoor air pollution data acquisition scenario in a four-month experiment evaluating its autonomy and robustness under power and network disruptions. A stress test was also conducted to evaluate its performance against concurrent client requests.},

  abstract  = {Environmental timeseries data variety is exploding in the Internet of Things era, making data reuse a very demanding task. Data acquisition and integration remains a laborious step of the environmental data lifecycle. Environmental data heterogeneity is a persistent issue, as data are becoming available through different protocols and stored under diverse, custom formats. In this work, we deal with syntactic heterogeneity in environmental timeseries data. Our approach is based on describing different dataset syntaxes using abstract representations, called templates. We designed and implemented EDAM (Environmental Data Acquisition Module), a template framework that facilitate timeseries data acquisition and integration. EDAM templates are written using programming language agnostic semantics, and can be reused both for input and output, thus enabling data reuse via transformations accross different formats. We demonstrate EDAM generality in seven case studies, which involve scraping online data, extracting observations from a relational database, or aggregating historical timeseries stored in local files. Case studies span different environmental sciences domains, including meteorology, agriculture, urban air quality and hydrology. We also demonstrate EDAM for data dissemination, as instructed by output templates. We identified several syntactic interoperability challenges though the cases studies, that include managing with differences in formatting observables, temporal and spatial references, and metadata documentation, and addressed them with EDAM. EDAM implementation has been released under an open-source license.},

  abstract = {The data deluge following the rise of Internet of Things contributes towards the creation of non-reusable data silos. Especially in the environmental sciences domain, syntactic and semantic heterogeneity hinders data re-usability as most times manual labour and domain expertise is required. Both the different syntaxes under which environmental timeseries are formatted and the implicit semantics which are used to describe them contribute to this end. Usually, the real meaning of data is obscured in a combination of short data labels, titles and various value codes, that require domain or institutional knowledge to decipher. The FAIR data principles for scientific data sharing are stewardship offer a framework based on community-adopted metadata. In this work, we present the Environmental Data Acquisition Module (EDAM) which focuses on data interoperability and reuse, and deals with syntactic and semantic heterogeneity using a template approach. Data curators draft templates to describe in an abstract fashion the syntax of the timeseries datasets they want to acquire or disseminate. They complement each template with a metadata file, which is used to annotate observables and their properties (including physical quantities and units of measurement) with terms from an ontology. EDAM employs a reasoner to infer compatibility among syntactically and semantically heterogeneous datasets, and enables timeseries, format and units of measurement transformation on-the-fly. Our approach utilizes a local ontology to store metadata about datasets, which enables EDAM to acquire and transform datasets which were originally stored with different semantics and syntaxes. We demonstrate EDAM in a case study where we transform meteorological input files of four agricultural models. Our approach, allows to cut across environmental data silos and facilitate timeseries reusability, as it enables users to (a) discover datasets in other formats, (b) transform them and (c) reuse them in their scientific workflows. This directly contributes to the toolshed for FAIR data management in environmental sciences. EDAM implementation has been released under an open-source license.},
